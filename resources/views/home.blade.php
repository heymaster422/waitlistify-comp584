                What is this website?
            </h3>
            <p>
                Waitlistify is a simple website that can track classes students are interested in taking/waitlisting so
                that the CSUN Computer Science department can have a concrete number on how many
                students are interested in taking a particular class. 
            </p>
            <h3>
                Why was this created?
            </h3>
            <p>
                It began with a dream and a vision, a utopian future where Computer Science students no longer have to fight tooth and nail to
                enroll in the vital classes they need. No longer will students have to delay their graduation, nor would they have to resort to 
                begging professors on their hands and knees for the most valuable resource mankind has ever sought: permission numbers. To
                inspire future generations to one day achieve our dream, we created this website to serve as a template for what a companion
                website for the CSUN enrollment service could look like.   
            </p>

                How does this website work?
            </h3>
            <p>
                Users of this website can log in and enroll in classes they are interested in.
                They can also view statistics on how many students are interested as well, and
                view which ones are highly sought after.

                What was used to make this website?

            <p>
                This website was made with a combination of Laravel, Docker, and SQL. We used Visual Studio Code to write it, and we stored it
                on github.

            </h3>
            <p>
                This website was made through the combined powers of Oscar Cansino, Andrew Wong, and Michael Barseghian. We are Computer Science Majors at
                California State University Northridge, and made this at the time of our last semester before graduating.
